      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in college, one of my assignments was to code a Base64 encoder in ARM assembly. After many hours of study, I got it. First, Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at how ARM Assembly works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DNS Tunneling with Iodine</title>

      <description>Sometimes during pentest engagements in restricted networks, we might need access to the internet. Internet access could be used to exfil info or retrieve a tool or script. Because of the state of those networks, no data can leave the network boundry. Security is hard and although the internet can be blocked, DNS is sometimes overlooked and DNS queries could still work. This is were we can use DNS Tunneling to circumvent any blocks that have been put in place.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mango. Oh man. Getting user access on this box was intense. I personally have weak web exploitation skills when it comes to web attacks, so this box did teach me alot. In terms of realism, this box was definitely real-world related and I can apply everything I learned to any future pentests I will do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today at work, we made these two C Shells for embedded devices that run busybox. One is a bind shell and the other is a reverse shell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an OSCP student, I frequently searched the web for notes, tips, advice, or anything that would help me learn the necessary skills to pass the exam. This &lt;em&gt;field guide&lt;/em&gt; started off as that, a collection of gathered OSCP notes from around the web, but as I learn more, this post serves as a place to document everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This primer is for those that are interested in RFID pentesting. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start or if you are looking into RFID &amp;ldquo;hacking&amp;rdquo;, I hope you can take something away from all of this. I am in no way an expert and I am still learning as much as I can about this technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

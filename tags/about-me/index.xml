      <description>Hello! My name is Rafael Munoz and I am a lifelong security student. As you can see by this blog, I like to soak up as much of the offensive security knowledge as I can.
About This Blog Credit where credit is due so thanks to @kakawait for this beautiful theme you see here. This blog is built using Hugo and is hosted on GitHub.io.
